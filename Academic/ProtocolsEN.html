        <h2>Food preparation</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Take a beaker, fill with water and heat on the heating plate.</li>
          <li>Grab the Eppendorf tubes with the food from the last draw of the freezer.
            They should be in the back left rack.</li>
          <li>Keep a long tweezer closed tying a rubber band at the tip. Place it on
            the beaker. Put in between the tweezers the Eppendorf tubes to thaw they.</li>
          <li>Stir the food with a micropipette tip if it is needed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Flies preparation</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>Fill an ice box with ice near to the edge.</li>
          <li>Make a hole on the ice with a fly vial.</li>
          <li>Turn side down the vial and insert it in the hole. The cotton cap should
            be touching the ice.</li>
          <li>Wait until the flies are completely sleep. Larger the time they are on ice,
            more time they will need to wake up at the device.</li>
          <li>Take out the flies to a Petri dish. Keep it on ice until you need to move the flies.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Device setting</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>When the food is melted, grab the Eppendorf Multipette, place a new Combitip
            and set the dosage volume in a range between 4 and 6μL. Recommended to use 6μL.</li>
          <li>Fill the Multipette with food rising the leaver. When the leaver reaches
            the top, shoot one or two times on a paper towel to remove the air bubbles.</li>
          <li>Load one shoot in each cell hole. Start depositing the food deeper
            and rise slowly until complete the shoot. The hole must be filled
            completely with the food.</li>
          <li>Change Combitips between different foods. Then it is time to move the flies.</li>
          <li>Put in each cell unit of the Flypad one fly. Use a tweezer to move the flies;
            grab them from the wings.</li>
          <li>Close the cell lid carefully. Static electricity can stick the fly
            to the edge of the lid and can be smashed.</li>
          <li>Repeat until all cell units are filled. Extra flies can be toss on the ice.</li>
        </ol>

          <h2>Food tubes preparation</h2>

          <p>This should be done the day before to the experiment.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Think about how much beakers you will need depending on the number
              of tubes to use. Small tubes should contain 10mL of food.
              That is approximately 1 or 2cm of the tube.</li>
            <li>Pour inside the beaker the food from the food vials.
              Help you with a scale larger spoon.</li>
            <li>Heat the beaker in the microwave for short periods of time. Be careful to
              not allow food to boil.</li>
            <li>Left beakers on the bench and let them to cool down. To check if it is
              ready, place a hand over the beaker, if you feel the heat and humidity
              then it is not ready yet.</li>
            <li>Use micropipette tip to stir the food and accelerate the cool down process.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile the food is reaching the temperature, prepare the small tubes.
              Grab 16 tubes, put them together and hold them tying a rubber band around them.
              Depending on the size of the beaker, it could store more tube packs.</li>
            <li>When the food is cold it is the time to add drugs or another stuff.
              If not, move to the next step.</li>
            <li>Place the tube packs inside the beaker straight up. Level the tubes
              that everyone touches the bottom of the beaker. All of them should keep
              themselves straight up.</li>
            <li>Let them on a bench or a shelf to solidify the food. If you prepare the
              food around 2pm you can leave on the bench and put the caps the next day.</li>
